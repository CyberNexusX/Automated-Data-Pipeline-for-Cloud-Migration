# Cloud Migration Pipeline Architecture

This document describes the architecture and design decisions for the Automated Data Pipeline for Cloud Migration.

## Architecture Overview

The migration pipeline uses a hybrid architecture that leverages both on-premises resources and Azure cloud services to efficiently transfer data.

## Core Components

### 1. Source System Connectivity

The pipeline connects to on-premises SQL Server databases using the following components:

- **ODBC Drivers**: For direct database connectivity from Python
- **Self-hosted Integration Runtime**: Azure Data Factory component deployed on-premises to securely access data sources
- **Credentials Management**: Secure storage of database credentials

### 2. Data Extraction Layer

- **Batch Processing**: Extracts data in configurable batches to avoid memory issues
- **Query Optimization**: Custom SQL queries for selective data extraction
- **Change Tracking**: Identifies and extracts only changed data for incremental loads

### 3. Data Movement & Processing

- **Azure Data Factory**: Orchestrates the data movement with built-in monitoring
- **Python ETL Engine**: Custom ETL logic for complex transformations
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple pipelines running concurrently for faster migration

### 4. Destination Data Storage

- **Azure Blob Storage**: Scalable storage for all migrated data
- **Hierarchical Namespace**: Organized storage structure by source system and table
- **Access Control**: RBAC-based security for the migrated data

### 5. Infrastructure Management

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for all Azure resources
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-sized resources based on workload
- **Cost Management**: Auto-scaling and time-to-live configurations

## Data Flow

1. The pipeline connects to the on-premises SQL Server database
2. For each table in the migration list:
   - Creates a Data Factory dataset mapping
   - Sets up appropriate copy activities with optimized settings
3. Data is extracted in batches and transferred to Azure Blob Storage
4. Validation occurs to ensure data integrity
5. Detailed logs are generated for monitoring and troubleshooting

## Security Considerations

- **Data in Transit**: All data transfer uses TLS encryption
- **Authentication**: Azure Active Directory for cloud services
- **Credentials**: Stored securely and never exposed in code
- **Network Security**: Optional VPN or ExpressRoute for secure connectivity

## Scalability

The architecture is designed to scale for various data volumes:

- **Small Migrations** (<100GB): Direct Python extraction works efficiently
- **Medium Migrations** (100GB-1TB): Parallelized Data Factory pipelines
- **Large Migrations** (>1TB): Partitioned extraction with incremental loading

## Monitoring & Logging

- **Pipeline Logging**: Detailed execution logs stored in Azure
- **Alert System**: Notifications for failed transfers
- **Validation Reports**: Data integrity verification after migration

## Failure Recovery

- **Checkpoint Mechanism**: Records progress to resume interrupted migrations
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient failures
- **Manual Intervention Points**: Clear status reporting for human intervention when needed

## Performance Optimization

For optimal performance, the architecture implements:

- **Compression**: Data compression during transfer
- **Optimal Batch Sizing**: Configurable based on table structure
- **Memory Management**: Streaming processing for large datasets
- **Resource Scaling**: Dynamic allocation based on workload

## Future Enhancements

- **Schema Migration**: Automatic creation of destination schemas
- **Data Quality Rules**: Custom data quality validations
- **CDC Integration**: Change Data Capture for real-time synchronization
- **Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring dashboard
